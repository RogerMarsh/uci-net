Description
===========

This package provides a pure Python client-server `Universal Chess Interface`_.

The clientserver package is extented with the UCI commands.


Installation Instructions
=========================

Build dependencies

* `Python`_ 3.3 or later 

Install the package by typing

   python setup.py install

at the command prompt with setup.py in the current directory.

You may need to give the path and version of Python depending on your system's configuration:

   <path to python>/python<version> setup.py install

   For example

      C:\\Python33\\python setup.py install

         on Microsoft Windows or

      python3.3 setup.py install

         on Unix-like systems.

Runtime dependencies

* `Python`_ 3.3 or later.
* `clientserver`_ package.


Notes
=====

The dependency on the incomplete `clientserver`_ package has been disabled in this release so it can be used by 'ChessTab`_ to ask local chess engines to evaluate positions.

It is very easy to do the wrong command at the wrong time given the difference in protocol style between UCI and client server.
